  bo2k168kb is a stealer. Based on the asynchronous module, the code is readable and understandable. For detections on VirusTotal, it is FUD. If there are detections, they are likely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positives_and_false_negatives">false positives</a>; this is common in a language like Python unfortunately.
